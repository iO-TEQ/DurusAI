# HMI Examples — Usage Notes

These JSON files are examples from existing projects and may include project-specific constructs (e.g., identifiers, data bindings). Use them for layout and component inspiration, not as neutral templates.

## Aligning with the General Model
- Refer to ai_reference/hmi_config_layout_description.txt for a neutral overview of screens, components, styling, theming, animation, and interaction.
- Follow ai_reference/HMI_Authoring_Best_Practices.txt for consistent authoring guidelines.

## How to Compare
- Identify component types (label, image, button, container) and note their roles and styles.
- Focus on layout (position, size, layering) and visual styling (typography, colors, borders).
- Ignore project-specific data bindings, tags, or view catalogs; they are not part of the general model.

## Neutral Baseline
- When creating new HMI content, favor the generalized concepts and best practices over copying project specifics from these examples.

This README is intended to help you use the examples safely without carrying over project-specific details.
